## Rejection Sampling

This repository contains the program `SinSim.x` : generates and visualizes a
distribution according to the target function (sin(x)) and the user's choice of
three different proposal functions then visualizes the results [C++]

### Requirements

In order to compile (by typing `make`) and run the C++ examples, you
need the ROOT package installed (for visualization):
- [ROOT](https://root.cern/) (C++)

### Usage

All of the executables can be called from the
command line with the `-h` or `--help` flag, which will print the options
